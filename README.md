# StarSwap

StarSwap is a decentralized spot exchange designed for ERC-20 tokens compatible with EVM chains. It caters to projects that lack the funds to establish a sufficient liquidity pool for traditional DEX platforms like Uniswap. StarSwap enables these projects to offer their users a peer-to-peer token exchange in a permissionless manner, without intermediaries.
